***
This is a clone of the iFantasyFitness repo. It will be modified for this specific use case. Currently, a domain name and a Google API key are needed. Facebook login options are to be removed. Header redirects need to point to the site's domain name. The site will require an SQL database and a web server. Original readme below.
***

***
This site is littered with hard links. For now, they will be replaced with `localhost`. They will later need to be replaced with the appropriate domain name.
Some links are now broken and will need to be removed.

iFantasyFitness | Train Competitively
===============
Welcome to iFantasyFitness. This is an online game, where players score points by exercising. The more you do, and the harder the activity, the more points you get. At the end of the game, the players with the most points win.

This project is open-source except for security requirements such as database credentials. Original source code is licensed under the MIT License.

**To install on your own site:**

1. Download a release.
2. Create a MySQL database.
3. Create a file `php/db.php` that looks like the code below. Replace the strings (in double quotes) with your actual database information.
4. Create a file `login/tokens.php` that looks like the code below, replacing the strings with access keys from Google and Facebook.
5. Run the MySQL commands listed below.

Your `php/db.php` file should look like this:

	<?php
    // Database Access Credentials - DO NOT share or commit elsewhere.
    const DB_HOST = "localhost";
    const DB_USER = "mysqli_user";
    const DB_PASSWORD = "extremely secure password";
    const DB_NAME = "iFF";
    $db = mysqli_connect(DB_HOST, DB_USER, DB_PASSWORD, DB_NAME);
    ?>

And your `login/tokens.php` file:

	<?php
	# Facebook application details
	
	$fb_app_id = 'Facebook_App_ID';
	$fb_app_secret = 'Facebook_App_Secret';
	
	# Google application details
	
	$google_app_name = 'iFantasyFitness';
	$google_client_id = 'Google_Client_ID';
	$google_app_secret = 'Google_Client_Secret';
	$google_app_redirect = 'Google_OAuth_Redirect_URI';
	$google_app_key = 'Google_Browser_API_Key';
	?>

Security notes
==============
For security reasons, all tokens and keys in use are stored in two files:

- `php/db.php` for MySQL database credentials
- `login/tokens.php` for login-related API tokens and keys

It's up to you to get these tokens and credentials for yourself if you want to run iFF on your own server.

Bug reporting!
==============
If you find a bug please please please report it as an issue.

If it's a security hole, please send us an email, or fork the repository and send us a pull request with the fix.

APIs and libraries in use
=========================
iFantasyFitness currently uses the following libraries and APIs:

- Facebook Graph API and dependencies
- Google+ Sign-in API and dependencies
- Bootstrap 3.1.1 - http://getbootstrap.com
- Simplex Bootswatch theme for Bootstrap 3.1.1 - http://bootswatch.com/simplex 

Dependencies for Google, Facebook and other things are outlined in `login/composer.json`.

Note: The web server on which iFantasyFitness is hosted updates the dependencies of Composer, and Composer itself, on a regular basis. The files included in this repository may not be the latest versions.

MySQL Queries
=============
Run this query to set up your tables. These tables all belong in the same database.
